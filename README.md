## 📌 A Note on Forking This Project

**yes, feel free to use it** — just kindly give credit.

This project is open source because I believe in sharing and learning together. That said, it’s disheartening to come across copies that don’t acknowledge the work that went into designing and developing this site.

Please be aware that this wasn't built to be a template or starter kit, so if you're looking to dive into the code, I recommend checking out the official [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for help with implementation.

If you find this useful or inspiring, please consider giving the project a ⭐.
